				Realistic expectations

Estimation

-	Follow CURB rule (Complex, Unknown, Risk, Big) to determine Epic vs. Story. (source: Exploring Scrum: The Fundamentals, Dan Rawsthorne)

-	When you are asked for an estimate, it is usually to know when they can promise something to their clients. For that you want accuracy
	and not precision. 
	Example:
		
		1. Precision is: it will take 2 hours and 47 minutes
		2. Accurate is: it will take between 1 and 2 days

	The difference between the two is that it doesn't really matter how long something will take (precision) rather you want to know by when
	you can deliver that something.

Sprint retrospective

- Look at the burndown chart
- Brainstorm processes that can be change
- Audit your process
- Check if you improved what you commited to in previous retro
- Velocity chart (Compare between sprints)
- Revisit "spring goal"
- Explain the meaning behind spring goal
- Make a "Dog and Pony Show" for your demo
- Always ask the following question: 

	1. Start doing?
	2. Stop doing?
	3. Continue doing?


Daily Scrum 

- REPEAT AFTER ME: The daily scrum is not a status meeting. It is a commitment and communication meeting!


INVEST (mnemonic)


I	Independent	The user story should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story.
N	Negotiable	User stories, up until they are part of an iteration, can always be changed and rewritten.
V	Valuable	A user story must deliver value to the end user.
E	Estimable	You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.
S	Scalable (small sized)	User stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of certainty.
T	Testable	The user story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.


Independent

One of the characteristics of Agile Methodologies such as Scrum or XP is the ability to move stories around, taking into account their relative priority - for example - without much effort. If you find user stories that are tightly dependent, a good idea might be to combine them into a single user story.

Negotiable

The only thing that is fixed and set in stone in an agile project is an iteration backlog (and, even then, it can be broken). While the story lies in the product backlog, it can be rewritten or even discarded, depending on business, market, technical or any other type of requirement by team members.

Valuable
The focus here is to bring actual project-related value to the end-user. Coming up with technical stories that are really fun to code but bring no value to the end-user violates one of the Agile Principles, which is to continuously deliver valuable software.

Estimable
If a user story size cannot be estimated, it will never be planned, tasked, and, thus, become part of an iteration. So there's actually no point in keeping this kind of user story in the Product Backlog at all. Most of the time, estimation cannot be executed due to the lack of supporting information either in the story description itself or directly from the Product Owner.

Scalable (small sized)
Try to keep your user story sizes to typically a few person-days and at most a few person-weeks. Anything beyond that range should be considered too large to be estimated with a good level of certainty or even "epic" and broken down into smaller user stories. There's no problem in starting with epic stories, as long as they are broken down when the time to place them in an iteration backlog becomes closer.

Testable
Bear in mind that a story should only be considered DONE, among other things, if it was tested successfully. If one cannot test a story due to lack of information (see "Estimate-able" above), the story should not be considered a good candidate to be part of an iteration Backlog. This is especially true for teams employing TDD - Test Driven Development





Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
-------------------------------------



1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
