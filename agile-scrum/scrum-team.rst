Scum Team
---------

Scrum teams take a radically different approach. First of all, 


	entire Scrum teams, rather than individuals, take on the work. 
	The whole team is responsible for each Product Backlog Item. 
	The whole team is responsible for a tested product. 

There’s no “my work” vs. “your work.” So we focus on collective effort per Product Backlog Item rather than individual effort per task. Second, Scrum teams prefer to compare items to each other, or estimate them in relative units rather than absolute time units. (Ultimately this produces better forecasts.) Thirdly, Scrum teams break customer-visible requirements into the smallest possible stories, reducing risk dramatically. When there’s too much work for 7 people, we organize into feature teams to eliminate dependencies.
