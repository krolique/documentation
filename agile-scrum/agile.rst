What is Agile?
--------------
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds 
software incrementally.


First we should really understand what "time boxed" really implies.

Time Boxed
----------
Time boxing is simply fixing a time period to work on a task instead of working
on a task until it's done. Work until it's done is a waterfall model of
thinking. Focusing on small tasks (incremental approach) and not the whole
project reduces the risk of failure, scope creep and budge costs. 


This sounds awfully a lot like micro management. However time boxing is your 
best friend! These 3 examples of using time boxing can help you at being 
happier at what you do with your time.

	1. Use time boxing to focus, just the task at hand.
		
		Imagine you have a myriad of little tasks that arise as you begin to
		develop. “Just one line of code or a simple configuration change”
		we've all heard this line of reasoning when simple problems begin to
		arise as you write code. By time boxing to a specific task you can
		disregard everything else and focus only on the problem at hand.

	2. Use time boxing to prevent procrastination and perfectionism

		You can move a mountain one pebble at a time or in this case begin a
		daunting task with just one little small task. You can also prevent
		being stuck by dwelling on the grand design or architecture.
		Everything will come into picture one small section at a time.

	3. Use time boxing to manage you life

		Time boxing your work (Agile principal #8) will allow you to partition
		your work time and personal time into clearly visible (and manageable)
		sections. Burning out from work in not something you want to achieve.
		The whole process must be sustainable, from both the employee and the
		employer point of view.


Secondly lets understand the principals of Agile and what they should mean
to you.

Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
-------------------------------------

1. "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and 
continuous delivery of valuable software."

This premise is essential to everything that will follow. For now lets agree 
our customers are (almost) always right.

2. "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."

Lets think about this for a moment; always welcome new requirements even late 
in the development! Sounds kind of tough? Adjust already written code even at
the last moment. How can this be a good thing? Well, you can always say no but
that wouldn't change things a bit because ultimately you are driven by the
customer demands. If you embrace this thought at the start and write code
according to this principal and changes do come in and you have to in every
function, module or class then you can be prepared for almost any change even
at the last moment. 



3. "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple 
of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."

Ideally we want to show progress for feedback and also happen to be refined by 
a SCUM desire in continuous integration.

4. "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the
project."

This point is essential in SCUM and a good rule to follow. You should always
listen to anyone who is willing to give you input on your work. Additionally
in SCUM this rule is reinforced with not having well defined roles within a
group. Titles are irrelevant in SCUM as you strive to deliver committed
stories in your sprint.

5. "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and
support they need, and trust them to get the job done."

	The support and environment is kind of apparent however the finer 
	point in "motivated individuals" and "trust in them" are 

6. "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and
within a development team is face-to-face conversation.""
	
	This is essential in more than one way. This principal implication should 
	spell out a few organizational constraints to be agile:

		1.	Closer relationship to product owners (customers) to reduce
		bureaucracy and redundant hierarchy between product owners and
		functional agile team that executes tasks to produce
		"valuable software". 

		2.	Encourages things like pair programming in Extreme Programming
		techniques.


7. "Working software is the primary measure of progress."


8. "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, 
and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."



9. "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances
agility."

	Technical excellent and good design not only enhances application agility 
	it also helps to alleviate technical debt that 

10. "Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is 
essential."

11. "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
self-organizing teams.""

	

12. "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective,
then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."
