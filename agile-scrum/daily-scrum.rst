In the daily SCRUM meeting we should focus on our commitments and communicate progress and impediments. This boils down to announcing which JIRA tickets I am going to take today,
what work have I done on existing JIRA tickets and voicing impediments to your sprint progress. The SCUM Master(s)/Product owners should listen but take all subsequent conversations
to be addressed after the daily SCUM. Team members should not expect answers right away, neither should they hold up the meeting with questions; this meeting i just to communicate 


Examples of how a daily SCUM meeting might look like a status meeting.


    Joe: I am working on BAT-1147.
    Mike: I am working on Email System today
    …...

This does not help the SCUM process one bit as we are just communicating our commitments or to put it another way a “status meeting". Ideally each 
SCUM team member should try to address the following topics in their daily SCUM:

    1. What did I do yesterday
    2. What will I do today
    3. What impediments (blocking)


To power phrase: "The daily scrum is not a status meeting. It is a commitment and communication meeting"
