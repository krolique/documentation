Feature Creep
-------------

The most common cause of feature creep is the desire to provide the consumer with a more useful or desirable product.

A product typically goes through the general life cycle of

	1. introduction
	2. growth
	3. maturity
	4. decline


1. Focus the team on the project priorities
2. Create and manage a product requirements document
3. Feature scope, if any, should only be customer driven
4. Create a process to evaluate all potential changes to the feature list
