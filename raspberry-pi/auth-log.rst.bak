Inspecting Auth.log
===================
Perhaps one of the useful areas to look into whos connecting to your machine
via SSH is the `auth.log` found in `/var/log/` (granted this setup may not be
the same for all the UNIX/Linux distributions)


Finding Failures
----------------
You can cat/tail/less/more or whatever command you prefer to inspect the auth
log for failures. The following line will grep (and granted this isn't the
best reg-ex in the world) for most of the failed password attempts that the
SSH daemon encounters::

    >> sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep -i sshd.\*failed


Finding Top Offenders
---------------------
Again you may chose to do which ever utility to parse the log file (in this
example I've used cat) but the main goal is to parse the whole log, extract
IP addresses of failed attempts and sort them by their frequencies::

    >> sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep -i sshd.\*failed | awk '{print $13}'
        | sort -n |  uniq -c | sort -n


>> sudo /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s {IP/IP RANGE} -j DROP
