Types of Machine Learning
-------------------------


Supervised learning
-------------------

    1) A human builds a classifier based on input and output data

    2) That classifier is trained with a training set of data

    3) That classifier is tested with a test set of data
    
    4) Deployment if the output is satisfactory

    To be used when, "I know how to classify this data, I just need you(the classifier) to sort it."

    Point of method: To class labels or to produce real numbers

Unsupervised learning
---------------------

1) A human builds an algorithm based on input data
2) That algorithm is tested with a test set of data (in which the algorithm creates the classifier)
3) Deployment if the classifier is satisfactory
To be used when, "I have no idea how to classify this data, can you(the algorithm) create a classifier for me?"

Point of method: To class labels or to predict (PDF)

Reinforcement learning
----------------------

1) A human builds an algorithm based on input data
2) That algorithm presents a state dependent on the input data in which a user rewards or punishes the algorithm via the action the user took, this continues over time
3) That algorithm learns from the reward/punishment and updates itself, this continues
4) It's always in production, it needs to learn real data to be able to present actions from states
